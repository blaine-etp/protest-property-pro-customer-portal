<h2>Step 1: Know Your Deadline ‚è∞</h2>

<div style="background-color: #fef3c7; border: 1px solid #f59e0b; border-radius: 8px; padding: 16px;">

<strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Important Deadline:</strong> File your protest by <strong>May 15</strong> or within <strong>30 days</strong> of receiving your Notice of Appraised Value ‚Äî whichever is later.

</div>

<p>If you missed that deadline, you might still qualify to protest in certain cases:</p>

<ul>

<li>If you never received your notice, you can file up until the day before taxes become delinquent (typically February 1).</li>

<li>Depending on the situation, you may also have up to 125 days after your tax bill is sent.</li>

</ul>

<div style="background-color: #f0f9ff; border-left: 4px solid #0ea5e9; padding: 16px; margin: 16px 0;">

<strong>üí° Pro Tip:</strong> File early to give yourself time and prevent last-minute stress.

<h2>Step 2: Try an Informal Review First üîç</h2>

<p>Before requesting a formal hearing, you can schedule an informal meeting with the Bastrop County Appraisal District (CAD). This is often the fastest and easiest way to resolve simple issues like:</p>

<ul>

<li>Incorrect square footage</li>

<li>Property condition (e.g. roof or foundation problems)</li>

<li>Data entry errors</li>

</ul>

<p>If the CAD agrees with your evidence, they may adjust the value immediately ‚Äî no ARB hearing needed.</p>

<div style="margin: 32px 0;">

<h2>Step 3: File Your Formal Protest üßæ</h2>

<p>If the informal review doesn''t result in a change, it''s time to file a formal protest:</p>

<ul>

<li>Complete <strong>Form 50-132</strong> (Notice of Protest)</li>

<li>Submit it to Bastrop CAD by the protest deadline</li>

<li>If you''re using an agent, file <strong>Form 50-162</strong> as well</li>

</ul>

<p>You can protest if:</p>

<ul>

<li>Your property is overvalued</li>

<li>Your value isn''t in line with similar properties</li>

<li>You were denied an exemption</li>

<li>Your ownership info or property description is wrong</li>

</ul>

</div>

<!-- SECTION 4 -->

<div style="margin: 32px 0;">

<h2>Step 4: Prepare for Your Hearing üé§</h2>

<p>You''ll receive a hearing date before the Appraisal Review Board (ARB), a neutral panel of local citizens. Gather strong evidence to support your case, such as:</p>

<ul>

<li>Sales comps from similar homes</li>

<li>Photos of needed repairs or damage</li>

<li>Independent appraisal (if available)</li>

<li>Repair estimates or tax history</li>

</ul>

<p>You can attend the hearing in person, by phone, or submit a written affidavit if you''re unable to be present.</p>

</div>

<!-- SECTION 5 -->

<div style="margin: 32px 0;">

<h2>Step 5: Attend the Hearing</h2>

<p>At the hearing, both you and the CAD will present evidence. If you''ve submitted an independent appraisal, the CAD must meet a higher "clear and convincing" burden of proof to uphold their value.</p>

<p>Hearings typically last 15‚Äì30 minutes and are informal but important. Stay calm, stick to facts, and present your documentation clearly.</p>

</div>

<!-- SECTION 6 -->

<div style="margin: 32px 0;">

<h2>Step 6: After the Decision</h2>

<p>You''ll receive the ARB''s decision by certified mail or email. If successful, your assessed value will be lowered. If you already paid taxes, you may be eligible for a refund.</p>

<p>If you disagree with the result, you can:</p>

<ul>

<li>Appeal to District Court</li>

<li>Request Binding Arbitration (within 45 days)</li>

<li>Appeal to SOAH (if value is over $1 million)</li>

</ul>

<h2>üö´ Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Missing the deadline:</strong> It''s non-negotiable unless certain exceptions apply.</li>

<li><strong>Failing to document property condition:</strong> Use photos and estimates to support claims.</li>
